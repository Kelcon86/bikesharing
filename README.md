# Bikesharing

## Overview
After a trip to New York using CitiBike to get around the city, I created a presentation using Tableau to try to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

Using the tripduration broken down by hour and minute on the x axis and the count of bikes on the y axis, we can see the duration times for users in August 2019. The peak trip duration was just 5 minutes and the vast majority of trips were under 20 minutes.

Using the same x and y axis as the previous graph, I added gender to the color and filter fields to see how gender affected the trip duration. While we could see that there were far more male users, the trip duration remained short (5-6 minutes) for all users.

The graph above shows the user trips broken down by gender and weekday. We can see on the heatmap that the majority of users are subscribers and that there are more male users than female or unknown. The most popular days for trips was Thursday and Friday for subscribers and Saturday and Sunday for customers.

Using a symbal map we can see the top ending ride locations. By dropping the count of rides into the color and size filters, we are able to see that some of the most popular ending locations are along the Hudson River Greenway, a bike trail with water views.
